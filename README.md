# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis

The project creates a webpage that allows users to filter data on all UFO sightings by city, state, country, and shape. The user is able to filter the data by one criterion or multiple criteria simultaneously. The following discussion walks users through how to navigate and use the webpage. 


## Results

Without any filters entered, the input values represent placeholders for examples of what the user can input, and the table contains all UFO sightings. The data can be filtered by Date, City, State, and Shape. It can also be filtered based on a single criterion or multiple criteria depending on the desired result. When the user inputs the desired filter(s), they need only hit the "Enter" key to get the results.

#### The below image shows what the webpage looks like without any filters.

## Summary
The webpage is in its early stages. There are some limitations on its capabilities as it is currently, but the webpage can be improved with further development.

- Drawbacks of this webpage's new design
  - The user cannot easily see all the criteria that will return results, and if they try to input a criterion, it needs to match the data in the table in terms of date format, capitalization, abbreviation, and number of letters and words.
  - It is not obvious how to clear the filters unless the user randomly clicks around the page.

- Recommendations for further development
  - A dropdown menu for each of the filters can help the user understand how to navigate through the data and how to retrieve the desired results.
  - A "Clear Filters" button can be added above or below where the user inputs the criteria.
